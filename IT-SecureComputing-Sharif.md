## Network Security
This course introduces students to security and privacy issues that affect various aspects of computing, including programs, operating systems, networks, databases, and Internet applications. The course examines the causes of security and privacy breaches and provides methods to help prevent them.

## Database Security
The course covers classical and new topics related to databases security. As one of the most important aspect of database security is access control of subjects (users/clients/agents/…) to objects (data/code/devices/…), the main part of the course focuses on Access Control models including Mandatory, Discretionary, and Role-Based. Such models are investigated from the Secrecy and Integrity aspects of security in database systems. In addition to Relational Databases as the dominant model in the industry and academia, the new non-relational database models such as Statistical, Object-Oriented, and XML-based are studied from the security perspective. Database outsourcing and Oracle security are also discussed as the final parts of the course. 

## Advance Network Security
The objective of this course is to expose students to advanced topics in network security. Topics covered will include Firewalls, IDS, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, Worms, Botnets, Honeypots, Spyware, Phishing Attacks, Traffic Analysis, Anonymity, Routing Security, Network Forensics, Wireless Security, VoIP Security. in both wired and wireless networks. At the conclusion of the course, students will be expected to get a clear and in-depth understanding of state of the art in network security attacks and defenses.

## Cryptography Theory
This course aims to connect current knowledge of graduate student in information security to advanced cryptography through these detailed targets:
1. Deep understanding of cryptography concepts.
2. Understanding of fundamentals of cryptographic mathematics.
3. Understanding of introductions, concepts, and fundamentals of the modern cryptography.
4. Understanding recent researches of this topic in journals and libraries. 

## Formal Methods For Information Security
Diversity of computer security requirements results in introducing of different kinds of security models. In fact, each security model is an abstraction of a security policy. Importance of computer security motivates us to precisely specify and verify such security models using formal methods (such as set theory and different types of logics). In the first part of this course, different approaches for formal modeling and specification of security and access control (authorization) models are introduced and surveyed. In the second part of the course, formal specification and verification of security properties in security protocols using formal methods (especially different types of modal logics) are introduced. Introduction of BAN logic as well as Epistemic and Belief logic and using them for verification of some famous security protocols are the main topics of this part. During this course, students learn how to use formal methods to formally and precisely specify their required security model or security protocol and how to verify them using existing formal approaches and tools.

## Secure Software Development
The course introduces the secure software development process including designing secure applications, writing secure code which can withstand attacks, and security testing and auditing. It focuses on the security issues a developer faces, common security vulnerabilities and flaws, and security threats. The course explains security principles, strategies, coding techniques, and tools that can help make code more resistant to attacks. Students will write and analyze code that demonstrates specific security development techniques. The course objectives are:

## Applied Cryptography
A wide array of communication and data protections employ cryptographic mechanisms. This course explores modern cryptographic (code making) and cryptanalytic (code breaking) techniques in detail. This course emphasizes how cryptographic mechanisms can be effectively used within larger security systems, and the dramatic ways in which cryptographic mechanisms can fall vulnerable to cryptanalysis in deployed systems. Topics covered include cryptographic primitives such as symmetric encryption, public key encryption, digital signatures, and message authentication codes; cryptographic protocols, such as key exchange, remote user authentication, and interactive proofs; cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives and protocols, such as by side-channel attacks, differential cryptanalysis, or replay attacks; and cryptanalytic techniques on deployed systems, such as memory remanence, timing attacks, and differential power analysis.

## Computer and Network Secuirty
This course is an introduction to the broad field of computer, network, and information security. We will cover both computer security (including such topics as security policies, access control, viruses, etc.) and network security (such as protocols for maintaining confidentiality of email or for secure web transactions), along with some relevant background in basic cryptography.

## Reactive Systems Verification
This course covers specification and verification of reactive systems, including real-time and hybrid systems. Verification methods are discussed for proving that such reactive systems meet their specifications, with emphasis on methods that combine deductive and algorithmic techniques.

## Hardware Security and Trust
This course will investigate recent technology developments for the design and evaluation of secure and trustworthy hardware. Technology is required to ensure that a trustworthy circuit module remains secure during its entire lifecycle from design to manufacturing to deployment and operation. First, there is need for a design flow that can produce trustworthy circuits, and that will protect the hardware platform against tampering and the unauthorized extraction of information. Second, the manufacturing, integration and deployment of a trustworthy integrated circuit needs protection against malicious design modifications, or Trojans. Techniques are needed to detect the presence of Trojans in fabricated devices, and to locate them in the design. Third, there is need to implement support for trust at the hardware circuit level. Secretkey generation on the basis of a single device is a must for chip anti-counterfeiting, to handle hardware licensing and metering, and to build a base of trust for secure applications. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a challenging and promising solution to this problem. These and other topics related to the security and trust of hardware systems will be covered in this course.
